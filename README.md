# SalesWorkforce - (DevPost - QuickBase Hackathon 2020)

This project contains a Forge app written in Typescript that extracts faces from an image and let us add some caption/description for each extracted image faces. Also, this only works on Confluence. This app uses a 3rd Party API. If you're interested to know what's behind the 3rd Party API, the project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mecvillarina/forge-mecodes-face-ocr-api).
